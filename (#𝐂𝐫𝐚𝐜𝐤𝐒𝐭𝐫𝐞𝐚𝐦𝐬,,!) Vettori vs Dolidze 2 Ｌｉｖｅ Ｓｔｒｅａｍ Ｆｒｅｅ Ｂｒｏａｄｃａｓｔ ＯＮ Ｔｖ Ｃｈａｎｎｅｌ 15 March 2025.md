After an exciting pay-per-view last week, the Ultimate Fighting Championship is back at the Apex this week with an intriguing rematch at the top of Saturday’s Fight Night card.

UFC Vegas 104 start time

Date: Saturday, March 15
Start time: 7 p.m. ET | 4 p.m. PT
Location: UFC APEX, Las Vegas

The main card for UFC Vegas 104 begins at 7 p.m. ET, with the prelims starting at 4 p.m. ET. Vettori and Dolidze should make their way to the octagon around 10:30 p.m. ET, depending on how long the undercard fights last.

Vettori (19-7-1) and Dolidze (14–3) fought at UFC 286 in 2023, with Vettori winning via unanimous decision. The former landed 106 of 218 significant strikes (48%), while Dolidze landed 71 of 192 (36%). 

Since that fight, Vettori lost against Jared Cannonier. He competes for the first time in two years. A World Grappling Champion, Dolidze has gone 2-1 since the loss, competing thrice in 2024.

Despite taking time off due to injury, Vettori is ranked eighth in the middleweight rankings. Dolidze is ranked twelfth but has seen improvements in his game. He believes altering his style and emotions can play a factor against an inactive game opponent. 

"He hasn’t fought in a long time,” Dolidze said via MMA Junkie. “Everybody says maybe it’s bad for him, he hasn’t fought in so long. But I never think about the fights from this point of view. I just understand that we are all changing, evolving. Maybe he has time to change something in his game.

“But anyway, I still think this fight can be the same, how he was working and what he was doing with me. Because I have power. He knows. Everybody knows I’m powerful. Everybody knows my ground game and grappling. That’s why it’s always hard to find keys with me. But I still think that I need to be more calm and control my anger, and that’s the key to win this fight.”

Vettori (19-7-1) previously beat Dolidze by unanimous decision at UFC 286. The one-time title challenger claimed he "f---ed up" repeatedly in his last fight against Dolidze, and expects an even more decisive performance this weekend. "The Italian Dream" has only fought once since, losing a decision to Jared Cannonier, while Dolidze banked three more fights. 

Vettori suffered a shoulder injury requiring surgery, putting him on the shelf for 21 months, his longest UFC layoff since his debut nine years ago. The notorious hothead chomps at the bit to fight but said the time off allowed him to mature.

"I was in the UFC when I was 21 or 22. I was so naive," Vettori told CBS Sports. "Every bone thrown at me, I was trying to catch it. I wanted to take everything. This is the first time -- even in the amateurs -- to pull out of a fight because of something massive.

This will be Vettori’s first fight since losing in the main event of Fight Night in June 2023 to Jared Cannonier. He has been out of action since suffering an injury last year. The Italian has a career record of 19-7-1, with nine wins coming by submission.

Dolidze has won his last two fights, beating Kevin Holland by TKO at UFC 307 in October of last year. The No. 12-ranked Middleweight is 14-3 in his MMA career, with eight wins coming by knockout.
